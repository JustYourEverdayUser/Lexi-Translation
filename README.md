### Schedule
Lexi releases are published here and on [FlatHub](https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.dzheremi2.lexi) every Sunday (except for hotfixes). All pull requests must be merged by Friday 23:59 UTC+3; otherwise, they won't be added to the upcoming release.
Merging pull requests on Friday also initiates a string freeze â€” `.po` files are updated according to the changes made in the repository and are then ready for translation ahead of the Sunday release.
